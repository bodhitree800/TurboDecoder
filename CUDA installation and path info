CUDA path is to be set to the below:(Without this the nvcc command will not work)

export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/computeprof/bin


export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


opening visual profiler : /usr/local/cuda/computeprof/bin/computeprof &


export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

compile to find out registers used and shared memory
(add this extra option)
